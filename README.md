ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection

Description:
Email Spam Detection is a machine learning project that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, and a Naive Bayes classifier. It includes real-time prediction support and is built using Python and Scikit-learn.
Features:
 - Text preprocessing (punctuation, stopword removal)
 - Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
 - Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes
 - Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix
 - Real-time email message prediction
Tech Stack:
 -  Python
 - Scikit-learn
 - NLTK
 - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset:
The dataset contains email texts labeled as:
- `0` â†’ Not Spam  
- `1` â†’ Spam
